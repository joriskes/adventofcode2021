# Advent of code 2020
This year i'm doing advent of code in PHP 7.4. I'm pretty ok in PHP.
Used composer to pull in some helpful additions

## Running
Start by running `composer update` do download dependancies
Copy example.env and set the environment variable called `ADVENT_SESSION` with the session cookie of adventofcode.com
If you run your day solution for the first time you can use `php download.php <DAYNUMBER>` to download the puzzle input 
in it's own directory
